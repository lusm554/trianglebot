Update (second commit): while I was trying matplotlib I got the idea to create a telegram bot that will send triangles

How try it:
1. git clone https://github.com/lusm554/trianglebot.git
2. cd trianglebot
3. mv env .env
4. echo "TOKEN=your_token_here" > .env

How it works:

To avoid matplotlib issue(1) i use multiprocessing.
1. UserWarning: Starting a Matplotlib GUI outside of the main thread will likely fail.
